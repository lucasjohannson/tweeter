# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above

##Functionality 

When loading the page the application has reponsive design and will adjust based on the size of the window. if the width is smaller than 768px (typical tablet sizing) then the page will be displayed with all the elements in a column and the nav bar will flow into the header with the users image and name displayed with the same background texture. If the page exeeds that width then the nav bar will have its own colour and the header will be wisplayed adjacent to the tweets section in a row. THe nav bar will also be fixed at the top of the screen. 

If the user clicks the double arrow icon below "Write a new tweet" the form will be animated into the page. the form will not allow empty tweets or tweets that exceed 140 characters. when a valid tweet is submitted the tweet will be displayed in the tweets section with a hovering border, date of the tweet and icons that change colour when hovered over. 

## Remarks 

This was a great project to work on got familiar with JQuery and ajax as well as gained an eye for front end design and user experience.
